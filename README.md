## An Empirical Linguistic Analysis of Clitics
#### With a focus on endoclitics in Kurdish

This paper investigates the interdependent complexities of Central Kurdish endoclitic markers from an empirical point of view. Using a corpus-based approach, we analyze the usage and distribution of the pronominal endoclitics and the emphasis clitic *=îş* in Central Kurdish. To this end, we annotate a corpus of Central Kurdish with part-of-speech tags and also, specific tags for the target clitics. Furthermore, we analyze the behavior of these clitics at the word level using data generated by finite-state transducers. 

This work documents a new and rare phenomenon and analyzes it using a data-driven corpus approach. The collected data will also be useful for further analyses in the field.

The analysis is available in this [Jupyter Notebook](analysis.ipynb). The tagged corpus will be released shortly.
